## 1. Public API docstrings

- [x] 1.1 Enumerate the public API surface from `duckalog.__all__` and any additional public entrypoints.
- [x] 1.2 Add or refine Google-style docstrings for public functions, classes, and methods, including parameters, returns, and exceptions.
- [x] 1.3 Add small, focused examples to docstrings where they meaningfully clarify usage (e.g., `load_config`, `build_catalog`, `generate_sql`).
- [x] 1.4 Optionally add a lightweight test or check that ensures all names in `duckalog.__all__` have non-empty docstrings.
