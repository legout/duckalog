## Why

The README.md currently lacks a dedicated Contribution section, making it difficult for potential contributors to understand how to participate in the project. While contribution guidelines exist in various places (`openspec/project.md`, git workflow conventions, testing strategy), they are not easily discoverable or consolidated in a user-friendly location.

New contributors face friction when trying to:
- Understand the project's contribution process
- Find development setup instructions
- Learn about coding standards and testing requirements
- Understand the change proposal process using OpenSpec
- Know how to submit pull requests and get them reviewed

Adding a Contribution section will:
- Lower the barrier to entry for new contributors
- Consolidate scattered contribution information into one accessible location
- Provide clear guidance on the project's development workflow
- Reference existing detailed documentation where appropriate
- Encourage community participation and growth

## What Changes

- Add a new "Contributing" section to README.md
- Include development setup instructions (using uv/pip)
- Document the project's coding standards and conventions
- Explain the testing strategy and requirements
- Describe the change proposal process using OpenSpec
- Provide pull request guidelines and review process
- Link to detailed documentation in `openspec/project.md` and other relevant files
- Maintain consistency with existing README formatting and style

## Impact

- Improved developer experience for potential contributors
- Reduced onboarding time for new contributors
- Clearer expectations for code quality and process
- Better discoverability of existing contribution guidelines
- Increased likelihood of receiving high-quality contributions
- Consistent contribution experience aligned with project standards
- Reference to authoritative documentation rather than duplicating information
