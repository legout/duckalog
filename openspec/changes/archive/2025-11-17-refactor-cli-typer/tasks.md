## 1. Transition CLI to Typer and rename command

- [x] 1.1 Replace Click dependencies/usages with Typer, keeping command behavior equivalent.
- [x] 1.2 Update entry points (pyproject scripts, docs, README/examples) to expose the CLI as `duckalog`.
- [x] 1.3 Adjust tests to invoke the Typer app and the new command name.
- [x] 1.4 Update the `catalog-build` spec delta to describe the Typer requirement and command rename.
